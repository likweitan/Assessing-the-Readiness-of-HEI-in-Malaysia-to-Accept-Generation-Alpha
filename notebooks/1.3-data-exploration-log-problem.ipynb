    "# 1.1 - Data Exploration (Info Content)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the in depth analysis on the student performance in exams at public schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log_Problem.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "An exercise is a basic unit for students to learn a certain concept.\n",
    "There are multiple problems in a single exercise that all relate to a certain concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table records the attempt logs when students try to answer each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attempt timestamp is rounded to the closest 15-minute interval to reduce privacy concerns.\n",
    "The uuid and ucid can be used to join the other tables (InfoUserData, InfoContent)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem_number refers to the number of problems the user had attempted including this attempt in this exercise.\n",
    "The exercise_problem_repeat_session refers to the number of times the user encounters this problem in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the answer to be correct when the user answered the correct answer the first time and does not use any hints.\n",
    "There are hints that the student can use that provides a step-by-step guide to get the correct answer.\n",
    "Each time a student uses a hint, a step of the step-by-step guide is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Proficiency Mechanism\n",
    "According to the forgetting curve proposed by psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, by doing spaced repetition review in learning, we can improve the memory of the newly learned concepts and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, Junyi Academy used the \"Proficiency Mechanism\" to encourage students to come back and review at regular intervals.\n",
    "The \"Proficiency Mechanism\" allows students to convert short-term memory into long-term memory through appropriate and repeated review.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five possible levels, all users start from level 0 and progress to level 4 which we considered Proficient for that exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reach level 1, the user will have to answer the problems correctly 5 times in the recent 6 problems attempts in the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reaching level 1, the user is required to wait 6 hours before he/she is able to attempt to level up again to level 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the waiting, the user will answer 2 problems from the exercise. For example, the user is at level 2 and get a chance to answer 2 problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both are correct, the user is upgraded to level 3.\n",
    "- If both are incorrect, the user is downgraded to level 1.\n",
    "- If one of them is correct and one of them is incorrect, the level is unchanged and the user is prompted to try again the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure to upgrade or downgrade is the same for the other levels. But users will not be downgraded at level 1 or when the user reaches level 4 Proficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reaching level 2, the user is required to wait 16 hours before he/she is able to attempt to level up again to level 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reaching level 3, the user is required to wait 40 hours before he/she is able to attempt to level up again to level 4, which is the final level and considered Proficient for that exercise.\n",
    "\n",
